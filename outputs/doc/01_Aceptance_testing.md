## 2.1 User Acceptance Tests
### 2.1.1 Test Case 1: GUI Layout Verification
- **Procedure**: Navigate through the application's GUI, verifying the presence and functionality of all buttons and text areas as specified in the requirements.
- **Expected Result**: All GUI elements are present, correctly labeled, and functional.

### 2.1.2 Test Case 2: Serial Communication
- **Procedure**: Open a COM port, send data through the text input, and verify that it is sent and displayed in green in the text area. Receive data and ensure it is displayed in the text area.
- **Expected Result**: Data sent and received is correctly displayed in the terminal area, with sent data highlighted in green.

### 2.1.3 Test Case 3: BAU Rate and COM Port Validation
- **Procedure**: Attempt to select and manually enter BAU rates, and select COM ports. Try opening a COM port with invalid settings.
- **Expected Result**: The application allows selection and manual entry of BAU rates, validates COM port and BAU rate before opening, and provides feedback for invalid settings.

## 2.2 Performance Acceptance Tests
### 2.2.1 Test Case 1: Background Reading Process
- **Procedure**: With a COM port open, simulate continuous data transmission to the application. Observe application responsiveness and data display.
- **Expected Result**: The application remains responsive, and incoming data is displayed without delay or loss.

### 2.2.2 Test Case 2: UI Responsiveness
- **Procedure**: While sending and receiving data, interact with various GUI elements.
- **Expected Result**: The UI remains responsive, with no freezes or significant slowdowns.
