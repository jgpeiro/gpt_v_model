## 2.1 Test Case 1: GUI and Controller Integration
- **Procedure**: Perform various actions in the GUI and verify that they trigger the correct responses in the Controller.
- **Expected Result**: Each GUI action results in the appropriate response from the Controller, confirming correct integration.

## 2.2 Test Case 2: Controller and Serial Communication Integration
- **Procedure**: Through GUI actions, initiate serial communication operations and verify that the Controller manages these operations as expected.
- **Expected Result**: Serial communication operations are correctly managed by the Controller, demonstrating successful integration.

## 2.3 Test Case 3: GUI and Serial Communication Integration
- **Procedure**: Send and receive data via the GUI and verify that it is correctly displayed.
- **Expected Result**: Data sent and received is accurately displayed in the GUI, indicating proper integration between the GUI and serial communication.

# 3. Test Results (Expected)
## 3.1 Test Case 1 Results
GUI actions correctly trigger corresponding actions in the Controller, indicating successful integration.

## 3.2 Test Case 2 Results
The Controller effectively manages serial communication operations based on GUI inputs, confirming the integration's success.

## 3.3 Test Case 3 Results
Data sent and received via serial communication is correctly displayed in the GUI, showcasing proper integration.
