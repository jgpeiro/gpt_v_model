## 2.1 Test Case 1: GUI Functionality
- **Procedure**: Navigate through the application's GUI, verifying the presence and functionality of all buttons, text areas, and dropdown lists.
- **Expected Result**: All GUI elements function as intended, allowing for interaction.

## 2.2 Test Case 2: Serial Communication
- **Procedure**: Open a COM port, send data, and then close the port. Observe the data transmission and reception.
- **Expected Result**: Data is correctly sent and received, with sent data displayed in green.

## 2.3 Test Case 3: BAU Rate Selection
- **Procedure**: Select different BAU rates from the dropdown and enter a BAU rate manually.
- **Expected Result**: The application accepts both predefined and manually entered BAU rates.

# 3. Test Results (Expected)
## 3.1 Test Case 1 Results
All GUI elements are verified to be present and functional, meeting the requirements specified.

## 3.2 Test Case 2 Results
Serial communication is successful, with data correctly sent and received, and sent data displayed in green, confirming the application's functionality.

## 3.3 Test Case 3 Results
