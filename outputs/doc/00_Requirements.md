# Requirements

# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the Serial Terminal Application. It aims to outline the functionality, interfaces, and constraints of the application to ensure clear communication between stakeholders and the development team.

## 1.2 Scope
The Serial Terminal Application is designed to facilitate communication with devices over serial ports. It will allow users to open and close COM ports, configure settings, send and receive data, and log terminal sessions.

## 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **COM Port**: Communication Port, a serial port interface on computers for connecting peripherals.
- **BAU Rate**: Baud rate, the rate at which information is transferred in a communication channel.
- **GUI**: Graphical User Interface.
