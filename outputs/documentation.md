This template provides a basic structure for a Serial Terminal Application, including GUI layout and serial communication functionality. It demonstrates how to list COM ports, select BAU rates, open/close serial ports, and send/receive data. The application uses PyQt5 for the GUI, the `serial` library for serial communication, and implements a background thread for reading serial data without freezing the GUI. Logging is used for debugging purposes.```python

This template provides a basic structure for unit testing the `list_com_ports` function and the `SerialThread` class from the main application. The `TestListComPorts` class tests that the `list_com_ports` function correctly lists available COM ports using a mock of the `serial.tools.list_ports.comports` function. The `TestSerialThread` class tests the functionality of the `SerialThread` class, specifically its ability to start, receive data, and stop, by mocking the `serial.Serial` class to simulate serial port behavior. 

Remember, for a real-world application, you would likely have more comprehensive tests covering all critical functionalities and edge cases.# integration_tests.py TEMPLATE
